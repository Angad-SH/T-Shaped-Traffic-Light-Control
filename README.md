# T-Shaped-Traffic-Light-Control To deal with a basic design of a Traffic Light Control for T-Shaped Road  and test the output using Verilog HDL.

Abstract: 
Traffic control is a challenging problem in many cities. This is due to the large number of vehicles and the high dynamics of the traffic system. Poor traffic systems are the big reason for accidents, time losses. In this method of approach, it will 
reduce the waiting time of the vehicles at traffic signals. The hardware design has been developed using Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL) programming.  
Verilog designing is hardware descriptive language, the name itself suggest that it deals with the hardware designing and simulation. Basically, it becomes very difficult to mount the various electronic components on breadboard or PCB circuit. 
It also takes too much time for the simulation and sometimes many errors occur because of improper connection of components onto the circuit.  
And thus, to overcome this factor hardware descriptive language comes into conclusion. we can code the process using Verilog and we can mount it on a circuit or just upload it to the circuit accordingly so that circuit will work as according to 
the code we have written.  
HDL language is often used for sequential circuits like shift register, combinational logic circuit like adder, subtractor etc. Basically it describes the digital systems like microprocessor or a memory. Whatever design that is described in HDL are 
independent, it has its unique state of work, very much easy to simulate, designing and debugging, and very useful than schematics, especially for large circuits thus, to overcome difficulties or problems to design the circuits manually with breadboard and PCB, use of Verilog designing in this complex world is increasing a way better.  
This project deals with a basic design of a T - Shaped Road for traffic light control. 
The output of system has been tested using Xilinx.
